# Way of work
## How do I start quickly with new technology?
Whenever I want to learn some new technology (eg. Node, BASH, RPA, ROS, C++, robotics, IoT, etc... I will call it `<tech>`) I google following phrases:
* `<tech> crash course` and I am learning basics, what gives me a rough idea about what is it about. 
* `<tech> cheat sheet` so I can ensure I know all options/functions/commands and to keep them in mind.
* `<tech> awesome` repo and I familiarize myself with the best libraries, courses, frameworks, etc. 
* `<tech> weekly` and I am subscribing a weekly mailing list (newsletter), so I can be up-to-dated with what's new in the topic area.
