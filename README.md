# How do I start quickly with new technology?
When it comes to learning a new technology (`<tech>` - eg. `Kafka`, `RPA`, `ROS`, `C++`, etc...), I follow a specific, yet flexible approach that involves multiple angles of exposure. This isn't about in-depth study from the get-go, but rather about building a holistic understanding by engaging with the material in various ways. Here's my method:

1. **`<tech> Documentation`**: Begin with a scan of the official documentation. Identify key terms and concepts to get an overview of the technology.
2. **`<tech> Quick Start`**: Look for a 'Quick Start' guide or tutorial to understand how to set up and get the technology running.
3. **`<tech> Crash Course`**: Engage with a crash course to learn the basics and core concepts, providing a broad understanding of what the technology is about.
4. **`<tech> Cheat Sheet`**: Utilize a cheat sheet to familiarize yourself with the most important commands, functions, or features.
5. **`<tech> Awesome` Repository**: Explore a community-curated 'awesome' list for the best libraries, tools, and resources in the field.
6. **`<tech> Weekly` Newsletter**: Subscribe to a relevant weekly newsletter to stay updated with the latest trends and developments.

This multifaceted approach fosters the development of a multidimensional network of concepts related to the technology. It's about exposing your brain to the same topic from various viewpoints, enhancing the learning process and retention of information more effectively than through deep, single-instance study.


# How do I start quickly with new technology?
Whenever I want to learn some new technology (eg. Node, BASH, RPA, ROS, C++, robotics, IoT, etc... I will call it `<tech>`) I google following phrases:
* `<tech> crash course` and I am learning basics, what gives me a rough idea about what is it about. 
* `<tech> cheat sheet` so I can ensure I know all options/functions/commands and to keep them in mind.
* `<tech> awesome` repo and I familiarize myself with the best libraries, courses, frameworks, etc. 
* `<tech> weekly` and I am subscribing a weekly mailing list (newsletter), so I can be up-to-dated with what's new in the topic area.

# TeamViewer as a CLI
It is possible to use TeamViewer without GUI, in pure console mode. Sometimes that may be helpfull if you need to get easy access to a remote server, that is located behind NAT.

``` console
$ cd ~/Downloads/ 
$ wget https://download.teamviewer.com/download/linux/teamviewer_i386.deb # for x86
$ sudo dpkg -i teamviewer_i386.deb 
$ teamviewer help # list of commands, but not all of them, I don't know why 
$ teamviewer info # check TV daemon status and get TV ID 
$ sudo teamviewer passwd [password] # set new password
```

If u want save space u can also install TeamViewer Host.

# Robotics
## How to start learning robotics without having a robot and what to learn? 
* most of the robots are built on ROS (Robotic Operating System).
* currently community is developing ROS2 and in most cases there is no point to learn ROS(1) anymore
* whole robot can be easily simulated in the software called `Gazebo`
* https://www.theconstructsim.com/ created bunch of ROS courses where you can easily start to learn on simulated robots - just buy subscribtion and start learning. This is not avertisment. Courses are really great and cover everything what you may need to learn. 

# LinkedIn 
## Tips & tricks
* on the first step you need to convice recturter, that you match to this position, time for convincing techincall people is later
* list of your skills is crucial for recuters, as they will reseach using it
* pass skills tests, so recruters can easier find you and be sure you are qualified in those technologies
* easies choice for the cover photo is a code image
* tell about your additional skills, that may help you find interesing position

# Jupyter Notebook
I regret I learned so late to use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

## Benefits

Jupyter Notebook is an incredibly powerful tool for everyone, including beginners in:
* programming,
* data science,
* scientific research. 

Here's why it's a great choice:

### Easy to Start
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Jupyter offers an intuitive interface that makes it easy for newcomers to start coding.
- **No Complex Setup**: Run it directly in your browser without any complicated installation.

### Interactive Learning
- **Live Code Execution**: Execute code in blocks and see the results immediately. This makes learning and debugging much simpler.
- **Experimentation Friendly**: Easily modify and rerun code to understand how different components work.

## Integration of Code and Documentation
- **Markdown Support**: Alongside code, you can add notes and documentation using Markdown, making it easier to understand your thought process.
- **Rich Text Elements**: Include HTML, images, videos, and links for a more comprehensive learning and making technical notes experience.

## Visualization Tools
- **Data Visualization**: Directly visualize data with charts and graphs within the notebook.
- **Interactive Output**: Outputs are not just static but can be interactive, enhancing the learning and exploration experience.

## Wide Language Support
- **Supports Multiple Languages**: Primarily supports Python, but you can also use languages like R and Julia, and even Node.js with additional setups.

## Community and Resources
- **Extensive Community**: Benefit from a large community of users and a wealth of shared notebooks and resources.
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Regular updates and a growing list of extensions and libraries.

Jupyter Notebook serves both beginners and advanced developers by offering an interactive, user-friendly platform for learning and experimentation, while also providing robust capabilities for complex data analysis, development of algorithms, and creation of detailed technical documentation and educational materials.

## How to start?
This is is simple:
* Just create `*.ipynb` file in your repo
* Install [Jupyter Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter) from Microsoft
* take a look on official VS Code [usage instruction](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)
