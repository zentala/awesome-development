## How to Quickly Start with New Technology

When learning a new technology (`<tech>`, like `Kafka`, `RPA`, `ROS`, `C++`, etc.), use a flexible, multi-angle approach for a holistic understanding. Here's a brief method:

1. **`<tech> docs`**: Start with a quick scan of official documentation to grasp key concepts.
2. **`<tech> quick start`**: Use 'Quick Start' guides to set up and run the technology.
3. **`<tech> crash course`**: Learn basics and core ideas through crash courses.
4. **`<tech> cheat sheet`**: Familiarize yourself with essential commands and functions.
5. **`<tech> awesome` Repository**: Discover top resources in community-curated lists.
6. **`<tech> weekly` Newsletter**: Stay current with trends via weekly newsletters.

This approach builds a multidimensional understanding by exploring the topic from different angles, enhancing learning and information retention more effectively than in-depth, one-time study.

## How to Get the Most from JavaScript

As someone who has invested time in learning JavaScript, I've realized its immense potential for rapid prototyping. JavaScript isn't just for creating web pages; its versatility extends much further. Here's what you can accomplish with JavaScript:

- **Website Front-End**: Develop interactive websites using frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.
- **Web Games**: Create engaging games with WebGL.
- **Web Server**: Build backend services using Node.js.
- **Desktop Apps**: Develop cross-platform desktop applications with Electron.
- **Mobile Apps**: Create mobile applications with frameworks like React Native.
- **Browser Plugins**: Enhance browser functionality with plugins for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera.
- **Userscripts**: Automate browser tasks using userscripts.
- **CLI Apps**: Build console applications with Node.js.
- **Portable Apps**: There are bundlers available for creating portable apps.

JavaScript's ability to operate across multiple platforms with a single technology stack is one of its greatest strengths, making JavaScript developers excellent candidates for innovation departments focused on rapid prototyping. Their familiarity with a multi-platform ecosystem enables them to work efficiently across different domains, reducing the need for managing multiple types of developers. This cross-platform compatibility also allows for sharing code between various applications. As a proponent of fast prototyping, I highly value and recommend JavaScript for its versatility in quickly developing multi-platform solutions.

This is the beauty of JavaScript - despite its flaws, it offers a unique blend of flexibility, speed, and reach across multiple domains, making it a valuable tool in any developer's arsenal.

## TeamViewer as a CLI

TeamViewer can be operated in a console-only mode, without the GUI. This can be particularly useful for easy access to remote servers located behind NAT.

```console
$ cd ~/Downloads/ 
$ wget https://download.teamviewer.com/download/linux/teamviewer_i386.deb # for x86
$ sudo dpkg -i teamviewer_i386.deb 
$ teamviewer help # lists commands, but not all, reason unknown
$ teamviewer info # check TV daemon status and get TV ID 
$ sudo teamviewer passwd [new_password] # set a new password
```

To conserve disk space, consider installing TeamViewer Host, which is a lighter version optimized for continuous remote access to computers and servers, functioning without the traditional GUI of the standard TeamViewer application.

## Awesome Terminal
