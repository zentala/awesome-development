# How to Quickly Start with New Technology?
When learning a new technology (`<tech>`, like `Kafka`, `RPA`, `ROS`, `C++`, etc.) involve a flexible, multi-angle approach for a holistic understanding. Hereâ€™s a brief method:

1. **`<tech> docs`**: Start with a quick scan of official docs to grasp key concepts.
2. **`<tech> quick start`**: Use 'Quick Start' guides to set up and run the technology.
3. **`<tech> crash course`**: Learn basics and core ideas through crash courses.
4. **`<tech> cheat sheet`**: Familiarize with essential commands and functions.
5. **`<tech> awesome` Repository**: Discover top resources in community-curated lists.
6. **`<tech> weekly` Newsletter**: Stay current with trends via weekly newsletters.

This approach builds a multidimensional understanding by exploring the topic from different angles, enhancing learning and information retention more than in-depth, one-time study.

# Good README

## Technical Introduction
For an in-depth technical guide on crafting a high-quality README, visit: [How to Write a Good README for Your GitHub Project](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project).

## My Additional Advices
Make your README expressive and visually clear:
- Use **Icons** and **Badges** for quick visual cues.
- Include **Images** (like screenshots) to illustrate key points.
- Employ **Rich Markdown** formatting to organize and highlight information effectively.




# TeamViewer as a CLI
TeamViewer can be operated in a console-only mode, without the GUI. This can be particularly useful for easy access to remote servers located behind NAT.

``` console
$ cd ~/Downloads/ 
$ wget https://download.teamviewer.com/download/linux/teamviewer_i386.deb # for x86
$ sudo dpkg -i teamviewer_i386.deb 
$ teamviewer help # lists commands, but not all, reason unknown
$ teamviewer info # check TV daemon status and get TV ID 
$ sudo teamviewer passwd [new_password] # set a new password
```

To conserve disk space, consider installing TeamViewer Host, which is a lighter version optimized for continuous remote access to computers and servers, functioning without the traditional GUI of the standard TeamViewer application.

## WSL2 + Windows Terminal + VSCode Remote Explorer

This trio offers a seamless integration of Linux and Windows environments, supported natively by Microsoft. The combination of WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and Windows Terminal provides a robust platform for running a real Linux environment on Windows, while maintaining the comfort and familiarity of the Windows OS.

### Key Integration Features:
- **WSL2 Integration**: WSL2 is deeply integrated with Windows, offering an authentic Linux experience. It's particularly useful for running Linux servers, testing cross-platform applications, and more.
- **Windows Terminal**: It supports various shells including PowerShell and the Linux shell through WSL. This versatility allows developers to easily switch between Windows and Linux environments.
- **VSCode Remote Explorer**: This feature in VSCode supports WSL targets, allowing you to develop in a Linux-based environment directly from VSCode on Windows.

This collaboration between VSCode Remote Explorer, Windows Terminal, and WSL2 represents a significant stride in cross-platform development. Developers can effortlessly manage and navigate both Windows and Linux environments, leveraging the strengths of each for a more efficient workflow. Regular updates and improvements to these tools continue to enhance their integration, making them a powerful combination for modern development needs.
