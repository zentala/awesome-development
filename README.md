## How do I start quickly with new technology?
Whenever I want to learn some new technology (eg. Node, BASH, RPA, ROS, C++, robotics, IoT, etc... I will call it `<tech>`) I google following phrases:
* `<tech> crash course` and I am learning basics, what gives me a rough idea about what is it about. 
* `<tech> cheat sheet` so I can ensure I know all options/functions/commands and to keep them in mind.
* `<tech> awesome` repo and I familiarize myself with the best libraries, courses, frameworks, etc. 
* `<tech> weekly` and I am subscribing a weekly mailing list (newsletter), so I can be up-to-dated with what's new in the topic area.

It is possible to use TeamViewer without GUI, in pure console mode. Sometimes that may be helpfull if you need to get easy access to a remote server, that is located behind NAT.

$ cd ~/Downloads/ 
$ wget https://download.teamviewer.com/download/linux/teamviewer_i386.deb # for x86
$ sudo dpkg -i teamviewer_i386.deb 
$ teamviewer help # list of commands, but not all of them, I don't know why 
$ teamviewer info # check TV daemon status and get TV ID 
$ sudo teamviewer passwd [password] # set new password
```
