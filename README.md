# TeamViewer as a CLI
It is possible to use TeamViewer without GUI, in pure console mode. Sometimes that may be helpfull if you need to get easy access to a remote server, that is located behind NAT.

``` console
$ cd ~/Downloads/ 
$ wget https://download.teamviewer.com/download/linux/teamviewer_i386.deb # for x86
$ sudo dpkg -i teamviewer_i386.deb 
$ teamviewer help # list of commands, but not all of them, I don't know why 
$ teamviewer info # check TV daemon status and get TV ID 
$ sudo teamviewer passwd [password] # set new password
```

If u want save space u can also install TeamViewer Host.
