# How to Quickly Start with New Technology?
When learning a new technology (`<tech>`, like `Kafka`, `RPA`, `ROS`, `C++`, etc.) involve a flexible, multi-angle approach for a holistic understanding. Hereâ€™s a brief method:

1. **`<tech> docs`**: Start with a quick scan of official docs to grasp key concepts.
2. **`<tech> quick start`**: Use 'Quick Start' guides to set up and run the technology.
3. **`<tech> crash course`**: Learn basics and core ideas through crash courses.
4. **`<tech> cheat sheet`**: Familiarize with essential commands and functions.
5. **`<tech> awesome` Repository**: Discover top resources in community-curated lists.
6. **`<tech> weekly` Newsletter**: Stay current with trends via weekly newsletters.

This approach builds a multidimensional understanding by exploring the topic from different angles, enhancing learning and information retention more than in-depth, one-time study.

# Good README

## Technical Introduction
For an in-depth technical guide on crafting a high-quality README, visit: [How to Write a Good README for Your GitHub Project](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project).

## My Additional Advices
Make your README expressive and visually clear:
- Use **Icons** and **Badges** for quick visual cues.
- Include **Images** (like screenshots) to illustrate key points.
- Employ **Rich Markdown** formatting to organize and highlight information effectively.



# TeamViewer as a CLI
TeamViewer can be operated in a console-only mode, without the GUI. This can be particularly useful for easy access to remote servers located behind NAT.

``` console
$ cd ~/Downloads/ 
$ wget https://download.teamviewer.com/download/linux/teamviewer_i386.deb # for x86
$ sudo dpkg -i teamviewer_i386.deb 
$ teamviewer help # lists commands, but not all, reason unknown
$ teamviewer info # check TV daemon status and get TV ID 
$ sudo teamviewer passwd [new_password] # set a new password
```

To conserve disk space, consider installing TeamViewer Host, which is a lighter version optimized for continuous remote access to computers and servers, functioning without the traditional GUI of the standard TeamViewer application.

* currently community is developing ROS2 and in most cases there is no point to learn ROS(1) anymore
* whole robot can be easily simulated in the software called `Gazebo`
* https://www.theconstructsim.com/ created bunch of ROS courses where you can easily start to learn on simulated robots - just buy subscribtion and start learning. This is not avertisment. Courses are really great and cover everything what you may need to learn.

# Jupyter Notebook
I regret I learned so late to use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

## Benefits

Jupyter Notebook is an incredibly powerful tool for everyone, including beginners in:
* programming,
* data science,
* scientific research. 

Here's why it's a great choice:

### Easy to Start
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Jupyter offers an intuitive interface that makes it easy for newcomers to start coding.
- **No Complex Setup**: Run it directly in your browser without any complicated installation.

### Interactive Learning
- **Live Code Execution**: Execute code in blocks and see the results immediately. This makes learning and debugging much simpler.
- **Experimentation Friendly**: Easily modify and rerun code to understand how different components work.

## Integration of Code and Documentation
- **Markdown Support**: Alongside code, you can add notes and documentation using Markdown, making it easier to understand your thought process.
- **Rich Text Elements**: Include HTML, images, videos, and links for a more comprehensive learning and making technical notes experience.

## Visualization Tools
- **Data Visualization**: Directly visualize data with charts and graphs within the notebook.
- **Interactive Output**: Outputs are not just static but can be interactive, enhancing the learning and exploration experience.

## Wide Language Support
- **Supports Multiple Languages**: Primarily supports Python, but you can also use languages like R and Julia, and even Node.js with additional setups.

## Community and Resources
- **Extensive Community**: Benefit from a large community of users and a wealth of shared notebooks and resources.
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Regular updates and a growing list of extensions and libraries.

Jupyter Notebook serves both beginners and advanced developers by offering an interactive, user-friendly platform for learning and experimentation, while also providing robust capabilities for complex data analysis, development of algorithms, and creation of detailed technical documentation and educational materials.

## How to start?
This is is simple:
* Just create `*.ipynb` file in your repo
* Install [Jupyter Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter) from Microsoft
* take a look on official VS Code [usage instruction](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)
