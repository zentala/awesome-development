# Robotics
## How to start learning robotics without having a robot and what to learn? 
* most of the robots are built on ROS (Robotic Operating System).
* currently community is developing ROS2 and in most cases there is no point to learn ROS(1) anymore
* whole robot can be easily simulated in the software called `Gazebo`
* https://www.theconstructsim.com/ created bunch of ROS courses where you can easily start to learn on simulated robots - just buy subscribtion and start learning. This is not avertisment. Courses are really great and cover everything what you may need to learn.
