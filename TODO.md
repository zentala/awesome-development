# Robotics

## How to Start Learning Robotics Without Having a Robot and What to Learn?
* Most robots are built on ROS (Robot Operating System).
* Currently the community is developing ROS2 and in most cases there is no point in learning ROS(1) anymore.
* The whole robot can be easily simulated in the software called `Gazebo`.
* [The Construct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/) created a bunch of ROS courses where you can easily start to learn on simulated robots - just buy a subscription and start learning. This is not an advertisement. Courses are really great and cover everything you may need to learn.

* Your list of skills is crucial for recruiters, as they will research using it.
* Pass skills tests, so recruiters can more easily find you and be sure you are qualified in those technologies.
